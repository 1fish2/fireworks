This example shows you can define and run a custom FireTask in the most simple way.

The definition of the custom script to run is located in the file "hello_world_task.py". You might try modifying this example to produce more complex behavior.

To configure, just go through the file "python_hello_world_run.py" and follow the instructions in the comments. You might also need to initially configure your database, i.e. "lpad init" followed by "lpad reset".

To run, simply execute "python hello_world_run.py".
